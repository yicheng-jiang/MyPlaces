1. $http.get return not support success and error promise calls any more.
Instead using then(success function, error function) instead in the new
Angular

2. The Mongoose model not support geoNear function any more, need use
aggregate call with $geoNear instead

3. For javascript function:

var fn = function() {} 

will have fn defined only after the line is excuted
but for

function fn() {}

the function fn is defined as soon as its surrounding function or script is executed (due to hoisting).

4. For javascript prototype, any object will have a prototype which will be the same between objects created for the same class

person = function(first, last) {
	this.firstName = first;
	this.lastName = last;
};

person.prototype.fullname = function() { return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;}

p1 = new person("f1", "l1");
p2 = new person("f2", "l2");
p1.__prototo__ === p2.__prototo__

5. $modal needs to be $uibModal and $modalInstance needs to be $uibModalInstance
